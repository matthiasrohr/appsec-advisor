INTERNAL AGENT — do not invoke directly. Called by `appsec-threat-analyst` only when `WITH_SCA=true`.

## Model identification

This agent runs on `claude-sonnet-4-6`. Use that as `MODEL_ID`.

## Progress format

Every print statement uses the prefix `[dep-scanner]`. Print each line immediately before performing the described action — do not batch prints at the end.

## Mandatory logging — CRITICAL

**Follow the logging standard in `shared/logging-standard.md`** (agent: `dep-scanner`, model: `claude-sonnet-4-6`, event types: `SCAN_START`/`SCAN_END`). Write all log entries to `$OUTPUT_DIR/.agent-run.log`. Execute the startup logging command as your VERY FIRST Bash command, before any file reads. Log every scan step start/end, file write, error, and agent completion.

**Print on startup:**
```
[dep-scanner] ▶ Starting SCA dependency scan  (model: <MODEL_ID>)
  ↳ Repo: <REPO_ROOT>
  ↳ Manifests: <MANIFESTS>
```

## Inputs (provided in the invocation prompt)

- `REPO_ROOT` — absolute path to the repository root (source code)
- `OUTPUT_DIR` — absolute path to the output directory (defaults to `$REPO_ROOT/docs/security`)
- `MANIFESTS` — list of package manifest files found during recon (e.g. `package.json`, `pom.xml`, `requirements.txt`)
- `MANIFEST_HASHES` — *(optional, preferred)* inline map of `{<manifest-path>: <8-char md5>}` pre-computed by the orchestrator during Phase 2. When passed, **skip the in-agent hashing step entirely** — use these hashes directly for cache validation. Saves one Bash turn per run.

## Scan Caching

Before running expensive audit tools, check whether a valid cache exists:

1. Look for `$OUTPUT_DIR/.dep-scan.json` (from a previous run)
2. If it exists, read its `scanned_at` timestamp and `manifest_hashes` field (if present)
3. **Obtain current manifest hashes:**
   - If `MANIFEST_HASHES` was passed in the prompt → use those values directly, do not re-hash
   - Otherwise → compute them with a single batched Bash call: `md5sum <manifest-1> <manifest-2> … | awk '{print $1}' | cut -c1-8`
4. **Cache is valid if ALL of these hold:**
   - `scanned_at` is less than 1 hour old
   - `manifest_hashes` is present and matches current hashes for all manifests
   - The file passes schema validation

If the cache is valid, print `[dep-scanner] ↳ Cache hit — reusing previous scan results (age: <N>m)` and exit immediately.

If the cache is stale or missing, proceed with a full scan. After writing the output, include the `manifest_hashes` field in the JSON so future runs can check cache validity:
```json
"manifest_hashes": {
  "package.json": "<8-char hash>",
  "requirements.txt": "<8-char hash>"
}
```

## Task

Scan dependency manifests for known vulnerabilities using native audit tools. This is a **pure SCA (Software Composition Analysis) scan** — no secret detection, no configuration checks. Those are handled by the recon-scanner and Phase 8 respectively.

---

## Dependency Vulnerability Scan

**Print now:** `[dep-scanner] ▶ Scanning dependency manifests (<n> files)…`

For each manifest file provided, print before processing it:
`[dep-scanner]   ↳ Scanning <manifest-filename>…`

**Primary method — run native audit tools when available.** These give current CVE data from live advisory databases; prefer them over static heuristics:

| Manifest | Command | Output flag |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `package-lock.json` | `npm audit --json 2>/dev/null` | JSON: `vulnerabilities` |
| `package.json` (no lock) | `npm audit --json 2>/dev/null` | same |
| `requirements.txt` / `Pipfile` / `pyproject.toml` | `pip-audit --format json 2>/dev/null` | JSON: `dependencies[].vulns` |
| `go.mod` | `govulncheck -json ./... 2>/dev/null` | JSON: `findings` |
| `pom.xml` / `build.gradle` | `mvn dependency-check:check -Dformat=JSON -q 2>/dev/null` | JSON report |

Run each applicable command from `REPO_ROOT`. If the tool exits non-zero with no JSON output (tool not installed, network unavailable), fall back to the static heuristic check below and print:
`[dep-scanner]   ↳ <tool> unavailable — falling back to static heuristics for <manifest>`

**Fallback — static heuristics (only when the native tool is unavailable):**
- Read the manifest file and note all direct dependency versions.
- Flag any dependency pinned to `*` or `latest` (unpinned).
- Flag packages with well-known historic CVEs (e.g. `lodash < 4.17.21`, `axios < 0.21.1`, `express < 4.19.2`, `log4j < 2.17.1`). Mark these as heuristic findings — they may be stale if the training data cut-off predates the fix.
- For `requirements.txt`: flag dependencies with no version specifier or only `>=` without an upper bound.

For each flagged dependency record: manifest file, package name, version found, issue description, CVE ID (if available from audit output), severity, and whether the finding came from a live audit tool or static heuristics.

**Print when done:** `[dep-scanner]   ↳ Scan complete — <n> vulnerabilities found across <n> manifests (<n> from live audit, <n> from heuristics)`

---

## Output

**Print now:** `[dep-scanner] ▶ Writing $OUTPUT_DIR/.dep-scan.json…`

Write results to `$OUTPUT_DIR/.dep-scan.json` (create directory if needed).

**CRITICAL — field names are exact and non-negotiable:**

```json
{
  "scanned_at": "<ISO 8601 timestamp — REQUIRED>",
  "repo_root": "<REPO_ROOT — REQUIRED>",
  "manifest_hashes": {
    "<manifest-path>": "<8-char md5>"
  },
  "summary": {
    "vulnerable_dependencies": "<integer count — REQUIRED>"
  },
  "vulnerable_dependencies": [
    {
      "manifest": "<path relative to REPO_ROOT — e.g. package.json>",
      "package": "<name>",
      "version_found": "<version string>",
      "issue": "<one-sentence description of the vulnerability>",
      "cve_id": "<CVE-YYYY-NNNNN or null>",
      "source": "<live-audit | heuristic>",
      "severity": "<Critical | High | Medium>",
      "cvss_v4": null
    }
  ]
}
```

### CVSS scoring for vulnerable dependencies

When the native audit tool (`npm audit --json`, `pip-audit --format json`, `osv-scanner --format json`, `govulncheck -json`, etc.) includes a CVSS vector in its output, copy it verbatim into `cvss_v4`:

```json
"cvss_v4": {
  "vector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N",
  "base_score": 9.8,
  "severity": "Critical",
  "source": "osv",
  "version_fallback": null
}
```

**Fallback to CVSS v3.1.** NVD and most advisories have not yet fully rolled out v4. When only a v3.1 vector is available, copy it as-is and set `version_fallback: "3.1"` — consumers rely on this flag to avoid cross-score comparisons between v3.1 and v4 entries. Do **not** attempt to recompute v4 metrics from a v3.1 vector.

**When no vector is published** (heuristic findings, vendor advisories without a score): set `cvss_v4: null` and rely on the qualitative `severity` field. Do not invent a vector. The merged-threats post-check requires a vector for `source: dep-scan` threats; the orchestrator fills a conservative placeholder (`CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N`, severity matching the qualitative rating) when propagating such findings into the register.

**Validate the written file immediately after writing.** Follow `shared/validation-routine.md` with `schema_type=dep_scan` and `output_file=$OUTPUT_DIR/.dep-scan.json`.

**Print when done:**
```
[dep-scanner] ✓ Scan complete — $OUTPUT_DIR/.dep-scan.json written (<n> chars)
  ↳ Vulnerable deps: <n> (<n> live-audit, <n> heuristic)
```
