> **DEPRECATED ID class — `AF-NNN`.** Per arch2.md, architecture-derived findings are normal `F-NNN` entries with `architectural_theme` metadata. No `AF-NNN` rows in Top Findings, no `§8.G architectural-findings` sub-section. Treat AF mentions below as historical reference.

### Build Management Summary — MANDATORY at all depth levels

**Prose-style anchor — read once before composing the draft.** The Management Summary is the most-read prose surface of the entire report. Apply the rules from `agents/shared/prose-style.md` (specificity, falsifiability, information-density, scannable structure, no boilerplate) to every sentence you write here. Load it now if you have not already in this Phase:

```bash
cat "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/agents/shared/prose-style.md"
```

Concretely for the MS: opening sentences carry the severity cue + the worst-case attacker capability — not metaphors. Bullet bodies name the mechanism (specific endpoint, file:line, library call). Architecture-Assessment defect descriptions describe the structural deficiency, not its rhetorical impact. Architecture-Assessment closing sentences are not sermons. Any sentence whose only job is to introduce the next sentence gets cut.

After the Threat Register and Mitigation Register are complete, generate a **Management Summary** section. This section is placed **after the Table of Contents and before Section 1** in the final output. **The Management Summary MUST be generated at every `ASSESSMENT_DEPTH` level — including `quick`.** It is the single most important section for stakeholders. Skipping it due to turn budget pressure is never acceptable — if turns are tight, reduce other sections (e.g., skip Architecture Assessment themes at quick depth) but always emit the Management Summary.

**Purpose:** Executives and architects who do not read the full report must walk away from the first ninety seconds knowing four things — *how bad it is*, *what the top risks are*, *what the worst case looks like end-to-end*, and *what must happen first*. The summary answers those four questions and nothing else. Per-threat details, file references, CWE numbers, severity counts and effort estimates belong in Sections 8, 9 and 10 — **not** here.

**Presentation rules (load-bearing):**

- **Scannability beats completeness.** When a choice must be made between "one more sentence" and "one fewer line", cut the sentence. The reader has 90 seconds.
- **Every T-NNN and M-NNN in this section must be a clickable link** — never bare text.
- **Zero severity-count noise.** The Management Summary does not render Risk Distribution tables, STRIDE Coverage tables, or severity totals (e.g. "5 Critical and 14 High…"). Those live in the Threat Register alone.
- **Tables over bullets for structured data.** Top Findings, Mitigations (Prioritized + Follow-up), and Operational Strengths use tables — they are easier to scan than bullet lists and align columns for comparison.
- **Worst-case scenarios are rendered as bullets inside the Verdict blockquote.** The Verdict section is framed by a red HTML box (`<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #dc2626; background: #fef2f2; padding: 16px 20px; margin: 0;">`) that contains the attack-path bullets with F-NNN references. There is **no separate `### ⚠ Worst Case Scenarios` sub-section** — the bullets inside the Verdict blockquote *are* the worst-case scenarios.

```markdown
## Management Summary

### Verdict

<Verdict — structured as: opening sentence + red HTML blockquote with bullet points + closing assessment. The opening sentence MUST begin with a severity cue — 🟢 ready / 🟡 acceptable with caveats / 🔴 not production-ready — followed by a plain-language verdict stating the worst-case attacker capability and, when relevant, Critical/High counts. Then a red HTML blockquote containing 2–5 bullet points, each naming one critical attack path in bold followed by a one-sentence plain-language explanation and an italicised F-NNN citation in parentheses. After the blockquote, 1–2 closing sentences with the overall assessment.

**Closing-sentence rule (load-bearing — failed in 2026-05 runs).** The closing sentence MUST add **new information** that the bullets above did not already convey. It MUST NOT restate the attack paths (the bullets already named them). Acceptable framings, in order of preference: (a) the business or regulatory consequence ("any user data processed by this deployment is treated as breached"), (b) the operating context that makes the posture critical, expressed in terms of repo-evidenced facts only (deployment reachability from the public internet, data classes processed, in-app rate-limit absence shown by a missing middleware import). NEVER open the closing with "No meaningful security boundary exists between…" — that phrase appears verbatim in the example below and reviewers flag it as a generic AI cliché. Do NOT cite compliance standards (ASVS, NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, etc.) in this sentence — pauschale "fails standard X" claims are not defensible without a per-control gap analysis, which belongs in a separate report. **Do NOT mention the absence of deployment-time perimeter or runtime controls (WAF, IDS/IPS, network firewall, API gateway, reverse proxy, secret scanning, database activity monitoring, EDR/SIEM).** A source-tree scan has no signal on these — they may very well be present in the deployment environment. Only mention such a control **in the positive** when the repo actually configures or references it (e.g. an `nginx.conf` with `modsecurity` rules, a `terraform` AWS WAF block, a CI step that runs trufflehog). Pick one of (a)/(b) and write a sentence that is specific to THIS system. No CWE numbers, no file paths, no threat counts outside the opening sentence. F-NNN links inside the blockquote are allowed and expected.>

<Example:>

🔴 **CRITICAL SECURITY POSTURE** — An unauthenticated attacker can achieve full system compromise within minutes through multiple independent paths. The assessment identified **7 Critical** and **12 High** findings.

<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #dc2626; background: #fef2f2; padding: 16px 20px; margin: 0;">

- **Full database theft without login** — A SQL Injection flaw in the product search lets any internet user extract the entire customer table in a single web request. *([F-009](#f-009))*
- **Admin login without a password** — A SQL Injection flaw in the login endpoint allows an attacker to log in as any user, including administrators, without knowing the password. *([F-014](#f-014))*
- **Server takeover from a normal user account** — Any logged-in user can send a crafted B2B order to run arbitrary OS commands on the server. *([F-010](#f-010))*
- **Admin impersonation via a leaked source-code secret** — The RSA private key used to sign session tokens is committed to the public repository; an attacker downloads it and issues valid admin tokens offline. *([F-001](#f-001), [F-005](#f-005))*

</blockquote>

Any customer data processed by this deployment must be treated as already breached: the application is reachable from the public internet, the database holds plaintext PII alongside MD5-hashed credentials, and the affected endpoints carry no in-app rate-limit middleware to throttle exploitation in flight.

<End example. The closing sentence above names the consequence (data treated as breached) and the operating context (internet-reachable, no detective controls), NOT a restatement of the bullets. Adapt the bullets and the closing to the actual findings of THIS system. For 🟡 verdicts the bullets describe caveats; for 🟢 verdicts the blockquote may be omitted entirely and replaced by a short affirming paragraph.>

### Top Findings

<Intro sentence: "The **<N> highest-risk items** across code, configuration and architecture, sorted by impact-weighted score. F-IDs jump to full finding detail in [§8.B](#8b-critical-categories); AF-IDs jump to [§8.G](#8g-architectural-findings).">

<⚠ MANDATORY single-table layout (Phase-5, replaces the legacy two-table form). The table lists findings DIRECTLY — no separate Top Threats category table. The Category column carries the architectural pattern signal; a category-level overview remains in §8.A for reference but is NOT rendered in the Management Summary.>

**Sort order (mandatory, enforced by QA Check 3h):**

1. **Primary — triage-supplied `findings_ranked[]`** from `.triage-flags.json → ranking.views.top_findings`. Phase 11 reads this view and renders the table in exactly that order. The triage-validator computes the ranking using impact-weighted-v2 scoring (severity 150× + impact 40× + breach 15× + likelihood 3× + top25 5× + cvss 1×; contributor −50; ranking-cap −100).
2. **Fallback** (only when `.triage-flags.json` is absent or v1): sort by `effective_severity` desc → `breach_distance` asc → `cvss` desc → F-ID asc.

**Threshold:** include findings with `effective_severity ∈ {Critical, High}` (detective-capped findings like CWE-778 fall under High and may or may not make the cut). Limit to **15–20 rows** — when more findings qualify, truncate and append a footnote `_+N additional ≥High findings — see [Section 8.B](#8b-critical-categories) and [Section 8.G](#8g-architectural-findings)._` Anchors use the unsuffixed forms (`#8b-critical-categories`, `#8g-architectural-findings`) — no count-suffix.

**Never sort by F-ID alone.** The table's job is to give executives and engineers the highest-leverage fixes first — numeric ID order contradicts that.

| # | Criticality | Finding | Component | Threat | Vektor | Primary Mitigations |
|---|-------------|---------|-----------|--------|--------|---------------------|
| 1 | 🔴 Critical | [F-NNN](#f-NNN) — <short finding title, ≤50 chars> | [C-NN](#c-NN) — <Component name> | [TH-NN](#th-NN) — <Category name> | [Internet Anon](#vektor-internet-anon) | [M-NNN](#m-NNN) — <short action, ≤30 chars> (P1) |
| 2 | 🟠 High | [AF-NNN](#af-NNN) — <architectural weakness title> | Architecture | [TH-NN](#th-NN) — <Category name> | [n/a](#vektor-n-a) | [M-NNN](#m-NNN) — <short action> (P2) |

**Primary Mitigations column — title + priority required.** Every `[M-NNN](#m-nnn)` link MUST be followed by a short action label (≤30 characters) AND a trailing priority token `(P1)` / `(P2)` / `(P3)` / `(P4)` in parentheses, matching the mitigation's rollout priority from the Mitigation Register. Example: `[M-007](#m-007) — Parameterize all raw SQL queries (P1)`. Bare M-NNN links, missing labels, or missing priority tokens are format defects that QA Check 3h auto-repairs using the M-NNN title + priority from the YAML Mitigation Register. When multiple mitigations address a single finding, separate them with `<br/>` inside the cell. When the finding has ≥3 mitigations, render the top-2 and append `<br/>+N more`.

**Column semantics:**

| Column | Width | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `#` | narrow | 1-based rank from the triage view |
| `Criticality` | narrow | Emoji + word (🔴 Critical / 🟠 High). When `effective_severity > raw risk`, append ` *(effektiv)*` and render the effective value |
| `Finding` | wide | `[F-NNN](#f-NNN) — <short title>` — **uniform reference schema** (em-dash separator, same as mitigations and threats). Title is the first clause of the finding's scenario, truncated at the first `:` / `.` outside backticks, max 50 chars. **Do not inline the component reference here** — it belongs in the dedicated `Component` column |
| `Component` | narrow | `[C-NN](#c-NN) — <Component name>` — **uniform reference schema** (em-dash separator, same as findings and mitigations). Single linked cell, no `<br/><small>` wrapper. Resolved from `threat-model.yaml → findings[].component` (the canonical component id) and rendered with the component's canonical name. For AF-NNN entries whose scope is the whole architecture (no single component), render the literal string `Architecture` |
| `Threat` | medium | `[TH-NN](#th-NN) — <Category name>` — the architectural pattern (enables scanning for systemic clusters). **Required** — bare text categories without links are a format defect. |
| `Vektor` | narrow | `[<kebab-case id>](#vektor-<id>)` — clickable link to Appendix A — Vektor Taxonomy. Values: `Internet Anon`, `Internet User`, `Internet Priv User`, `Victim-Required`, `Build-Time`, `Repo-Read`, `n/a`. Bare-text Vektor values without links are a format defect auto-repaired by QA. |
| `Primary Mitigations` | medium | Up to 2 M-IDs separated by `<br/>`, each with short action label AND trailing `(P1)`/`(P2)`/`(P3)`/`(P4)` token. When the finding has ≥3 mitigations, append `<br/>+N more` |

**Clickability rule:** every F-NNN, TH-NN, M-NNN in this table MUST be a live anchor link. The F-NNN links are the **canonical cross-reference mechanism** throughout the document — every architecture-assessment paragraph, trust-boundary row, and control-catalog entry references findings by `[F-NNN](#f-NNN)`. This single table is the primary landing page for every F-ID link in the report.

> 🔴 = Critical · 🟠 = High. **"(effektiv)"** = Severity elevated via keystone role in a compound chain. **Vektor** values link to full definitions in [Appendix A — Vektor Taxonomy](#appendix-a-vektor-taxonomy).

<Worst-case scenarios are rendered as the bullets inside the Verdict blockquote above — there is no separate `### ⚠ Worst Case Scenarios` sub-section. The bullets already carry business-language names and F-NNN citations; nothing further is emitted between Top Findings and Architecture Assessment.>

### Architecture Assessment

<Opening line with a 🔴/🟡/🟢 verdict cue in bold, then 1–2 sentences stating the architectural verdict. It is allowed to reference F-NNN links in this opening prose when they anchor the verdict claim. No file paths, no CWE numbers.>

<Followed by a short framing sentence introducing the table. Compute the percentage from the actual finding coverage, do NOT free-text it: count distinct F-NNN/AF-NNN references in the Key Findings column, divide by the total High+Critical finding count from the threat register, round to nearest 5%. Example: "Four cross-cutting defects drive 55% of all High/Critical findings:".>

<Table with the key cross-cutting architectural defects. Columns: Defect, Description, Key Findings. Sorted by impact. This 3-column schema is canonical.>

<Defect selection rule: prefer existing AF-NNN clusters, then weak/missing security_controls[] that mitigate High/Critical findings, then repeated High/Critical findings sharing a CWE, finding_type_id, component boundary, or missing control. Do not add free-form "architecture concerns" that are not backed by findings or control gaps.>

<**Completeness rule (D — load-bearing).** Every High and Critical finding MUST be cited in at least one defect row's Key Findings column. Before submitting the table, list each High+Critical F-NNN and verify it appears at least once. If a finding doesn't fit any of the 4 defect rows you've chosen, add a fifth row labelled `Other High/Critical Findings` and cite the orphan finding(s) there. This rule is the difference between a defect table that summarises the report and one that cherry-picks the easy stories — the second drives the user back to the Threat Register to discover what was skipped. Architectural-finding-class (CSRF, request-forgery, etc.) defects MUST NOT be included unless at least one F-NNN with the corresponding CWE actually exists in the register; do not invent defect rows that do not anchor to a real finding.>

| Defect | Description | Key Findings |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **<defect name>** | <one-sentence description of the structural weakness and its architectural reach> | [F-NNN](#f-NNN) — <short label><br/>[F-NNN](#f-NNN) — <short label> |
| **<defect name>** | <description> | [F-NNN](#f-NNN) — <short label><br/>[F-NNN](#f-NNN) — <short label> |

<The Key Findings column MUST include a short label after each F-NNN link: `[F-NNN](#f-NNN) — <short label>`. Multiple findings are `<br/>`-separated inside the cell. Bare F-NNN links without a label are a format defect.>

<Closing line linking to §7: `See **[§7 Security Architecture](#7-security-architecture)** for the full per-domain assessment …`>

### Mitigations

This section presents all mitigations in two tiers: prioritized (fix immediately / next release) and follow-up (subsequent sprints).

#### Prioritized Mitigations

<One intro sentence: these address the Critical/High findings from the Top Findings table above. Entries are ordered by effort (lowest first), then by number of findings addressed (highest first).>

| ID | Mitigation | Component | Addresses | Effort |
|----|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| [M-NNN](#m-NNN) | <title> | [C-NN](#c-NN) <Component name> | [F-NNN](#f-NNN) — <short label><br/>[F-NNN](#f-NNN) — <short label> | Low/Medium/High |

<One row per Prioritized mitigation. The Addresses column links back to the finding IDs from the Top Findings table. Every finding reference MUST include a short label after the F-NNN link. Every Critical finding in Top Findings MUST have at least one row here.>

#### Follow-up Mitigations

<One intro sentence: these address the remaining High/Medium findings not covered above. Same ordering rule (effort asc, then findings-addressed desc).>

| ID | Mitigation | Component | Addresses | Effort |
|----|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| [M-NNN](#m-NNN) | <title> | [C-NN](#c-NN) <Component name> | [F-NNN](#f-NNN) — <short label> | Low/Medium/High |
| [M-NNN](#m-NNN) | <title> | [C-NN](#c-NN) <Component name> | [F-NNN](#f-NNN) — <short label> | Low/Medium/High |

<Both tables use the same five columns (ID, Mitigation, Component, Addresses, Effort) for visual consistency. The Component cell is a clickable `[C-NN](#c-NN) <name>` reference; when a mitigation spans multiple components, stack them with `<br/>`. The Addresses column uses F-NNN IDs with short labels, `<br/>`-separated.>

### Requirements Compliance

<ONLY when CHECK_REQUIREMENTS=true. Omit this entire subsection otherwise.>

**Baseline:** [<requirements source name or URL>](<url>)
**Result:** <N> requirements checked — <N_pass> PASS · <N_fail> FAIL · <N_antipattern> ANTI-PATTERN · <N_partial> PARTIAL

<Up to 3 bullets — architectural violations and ANTI-PATTERN findings only. The full list lives in Section 7b.
Selection order: ❌ ANTI-PATTERN `MUST` first, then ❌ ANTI-PATTERN `SHOULD`, then ❌ FAIL with `architectural_violation=true` `MUST`, then ❌ FAIL with `architectural_violation=true` `SHOULD`, then ❌ FAIL `MUST` requirements when fewer than 3 architectural slots are filled.
Each bullet format: "- **[REQ-ID](url) — <title>** `MUST/SHOULD`: <one sentence describing the systemic risk and its business impact>."
When zero architectural violations or ANTI-PATTERN findings exist, omit all bullets (keep only Baseline + Result lines).>

→ *Full compliance details in [Section 7b — Requirements Compliance](#7b-requirements-compliance).*

### Operational Strengths

<When the overall verdict is 🟡 or 🔴, open with: "Despite the <intentionally vulnerable / structurally deficient> design, the project implements several security-relevant controls. None fully mitigate Critical findings, but each reduces part of the attack surface.">

<⚠ MANDATORY 5-column table. The columns are `Architectural Control`, `Implementation`, `Effectiveness`, `Gap`, `Mitigates`. Legacy 3-column form (`Control / What it provides / Limitation`) is deprecated and auto-rewritten by QA Check 3i. Every row MUST use a **canonical architectural control name** from `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/data/architectural-controls.yaml` (not a library name). List 5–8 rows minimum, drawn from the rows in Section 7 (Identified Security Controls) where effectiveness ∈ {Adequate, Partial}. Missing controls do NOT appear in Operational Strengths — they live only in Section 7.>

**Only genuinely architectural controls qualify.** Operational Strengths is the table where the reader looks for **system-level design strengths** that survive a hostile review: centralised authentication, parameterised data-access layers, KMS-backed key management, mesh-wide mTLS, ORM-by-default with disciplined raw-SQL escape hatches, trust-boundary enforcement, per-tenant isolation, dedicated authorization service. **The following do NOT qualify and MUST NOT appear here** even when present:

- HTTP response-header hardening (`helmet`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, `HSTS`). These are baseline expected hygiene, not architectural strengths. The `HTTP Security Headers` control in `architectural-controls.yaml` carries `excluded_from_strengths: true` for this reason; the renderer filters such rows out automatically.
- Mere presence of a single hardening library, default config, or one-line middleware without a meaningful architectural commitment behind it (e.g. `app.use(helmet())` with no further policy work).
- Deployment-time / runtime-environment controls that a source-tree scan cannot verify (WAF, IDS/IPS, API gateway, network firewall, secret scanning service, EDR/SIEM) — see the "Closing-sentence rule" above; the same prohibition applies here.

If you're tempted to add an HTTP-header row because the table looks thin, prefer instead to keep the table at 3–4 strong rows and lean on the `**Bottom line:**` sentence to acknowledge the modest defensive surface. Padding with hygiene rows weakens the section's signal.

| Architectural Control | Implementation | Effectiveness | Gap | Mitigates |
|-----------------------|----------------|---------------|-----|-----------|
| Multi-Factor Authentication | TOTP via `otplib` on std login | ⚠️ Partial | Not enforced on OAuth or API-token paths | [T-016](#t-016) — 2FA bypass |
| Parameterized Database Access | Sequelize ORM default | ⚠️ Partial | Raw string interpolation in search+login | [T-009](#t-009) — SQL injection product search |
| Authentication Rate Limiting | `express-rate-limit` on reset+2FA | 🔶 Weak | Not on /login; spoofable X-Forwarded-For key | [T-036](#t-036), [T-038](#t-038) |
| Centralised Session Validation | `express-jwt` middleware mounted at the API root | ⚠️ Partial | Algorithm allow-list permits `none` | [T-002](#t-002) — alg:none bypass |
| <... 3–8 rows total, one per existing control with effectiveness ≥ Weak; OMIT any HTTP-header / response-header / CSP / CORS row even if Section 7 lists one ...> | | | | |

**Bottom line:** <One sentence summarizing that these controls narrow specific attack surfaces but none eliminates a Critical finding on its own.>

→ *Full details: [Section 2](#2-architecture-diagrams) · [Critical Attack Chain](#critical-attack-chain) · [Section 7](#7-threat-register) · [Section 9](#9-mitigation-register).*
```

**Column semantics:**

| Column | Content | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `Architectural Control` | Canonical tech-agnostic name | `architectural-controls.yaml → controls[].name` |
| `Implementation` | One-line how it's realised here (library + entry point or file) | Free text |
| `Effectiveness` | One of ✅ Adequate · ⚠️ Partial · 🔶 Weak (never Missing in this table) | Shared scale with Section 7 |
| `Gap` | Concrete shortcoming, one sentence | Derived from Section 7 "Limitation" |
| `Mitigates` | Linked threats this control is intended to affect | `[T-NNN](#t-NNN) — <short label>` format, `<br/>`-separated when ≥2 |

**Relationship to Section 7 (Identified Security Controls).** Operational Strengths is a **filtered view** of Section 7 — rows with `effectiveness ∈ {adequate, partial, weak}`. `❌ Missing` controls live only in Section 7. The QA reviewer Check 3i validates that every control name in Operational Strengths appears verbatim in Section 7 (same canonical name) and that no Missing control appears here.

**Rules — the hard constraints the QA reviewer enforces:**

- **`### Verdict` heading first, with integrated red HTML blockquote.** The first sub-section after `## Management Summary` MUST be `### Verdict`. Structure: (1) opening sentence with 🟢/🟡/🔴 severity cue + one-sentence verdict + (optionally) the `N Critical / M High` finding counts, (2) **a red HTML blockquote** containing 2–5 bold bullet points — each naming one critical attack path in business language followed by a plain-language explanation and a parenthesised italic F-NNN citation (e.g. `*([F-009](#f-009))*`), (3) 1–2 closing sentences with the overall assessment. The blockquote uses `<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #dc2626; background: #fef2f2; padding: 16px 20px; margin: 0;">` with a `<br/>` spacer above it. The bullets inside this blockquote **are** the worst-case scenarios — do not emit a separate `### ⚠ Worst Case Scenarios` heading. F-NNN links are allowed inside the blockquote; CWE numbers and file paths remain forbidden.
- **Required sub-sections — exactly FIVE, presence and order enforced by the template:** `### Verdict`, `### Top Findings`, `### Architecture Assessment`, `### Mitigations` (with `#### Prioritized Mitigations` and `#### Follow-up Mitigations` sub-tables), `### Operational Strengths`. The `### Requirements Compliance` sub-section is mandatory **only** when `CHECK_REQUIREMENTS=true` and is placed between Mitigations and Operational Strengths.
- **Top Findings is a table, not a bullet list.** The table MUST have columns: `#`, `Criticality`, `Finding`, `Component`, `Threat`, `Vektor`, `Primary Mitigations`. Include ALL Critical findings and top High findings up to 15–20 rows total. Criticality emojis: 🔴 for Critical, 🟠 for High. Every Primary Mitigations cell MUST include a short action label AND a trailing priority token: `[M-NNN](#m-NNN) — <short action> (P1)`. Every Vektor cell MUST be a link to Appendix A. A legend line MUST follow the table. Finding IDs use the `[F-NNN](#f-NNN)` format; Component IDs use `[C-NN](#c-NN)`; Threat IDs use `[TH-NN](#th-NN)`.
- **Management Summary sub-sections MUST NOT be numbered.** Headings like `### 1.1 Verdict`, `### 1.2 Top Findings` are a generation defect — the QA reviewer auto-strips the numeric prefix. Every Management Summary heading is a plain `### <Name>` with no leading digit or section number.
- **Architecture Assessment uses a table.** The canonical form used in the reference output has columns: `Defect`, `Description`, `Key Findings` (each F-NNN link is followed by a short label via em-dash). A closing `See §7 Security Architecture` reference line is required. A legacy form with columns `Severity | Layer | Defect | Consequence | Enables` remains accepted but is deprecated — QA Check 3h does not rewrite it, it only checks that every F-NNN/T-NNN link carries a short label.
- **Mitigations section contains two sub-tables with identical 5-column structure.** Both use columns: `ID`, `Mitigation`, `Component` (`[C-NN](#c-NN) <name>`, `<br/>`-separated when ≥2), `Addresses` (F-NNN list with short labels, `<br/>`-separated), `Effort` (Low/Medium/High). `#### Prioritized Mitigations` lists mitigations for Critical / High findings, ordered by effort ascending then by coverage count descending. `#### Follow-up Mitigations` lists the remaining P2/P3/P4 mitigations in the same ordering. Every Critical finding in Top Findings MUST have at least one row in the Prioritized table. The legacy 4-column form (`Priority | Mitigation | Addresses | Effort`) is deprecated.
- **Operational Strengths MUST be a 5-column table** with columns: `Architectural Control`, `Implementation`, `Effectiveness`, `Gap`, `Mitigates`. The legacy 3-column form (`Control / What it provides / Limitation`) is deprecated — QA Check 3i auto-rewrites detected legacy tables. A 2-column table is FORBIDDEN. The table targets 3–8 rows of **genuinely architectural** controls (centralised auth, parameterised data access, KMS-backed key management, mesh mTLS, isolation boundaries, …); when more rows would qualify, truncate and append a `_+N additional controls — see [Section 7](#7-security-architecture)._` footnote. **Forbidden as rows** — HTTP response-header hardening (`helmet`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, `HSTS`), mere presence of a single hardening library without a meaningful architectural commitment, and any control whose `architectural-controls.yaml` entry carries `excluded_from_strengths: true` (the renderer filters these out automatically; the QA reviewer flags them when they slip through). Padding with hygiene rows to reach a row count is worse than a shorter, stronger table. Every control name MUST match a canonical name from `architectural-controls.yaml`. Ends with a `**Bottom line:**` sentence. The introductory paragraph before the table is mandatory when verdict is 🟡 or 🔴.
- **Forbidden sub-sections — the QA reviewer strips them on sight:**
  - `### Risk Distribution` / `### STRIDE Coverage` → lives in the Threat Register alone.
  - `### ⚠ Worst Case Scenarios` / `### Worst Case Scenarios` / `### Worst Case Scenario` (any variant) → **auto-strip** and merge their bullets into the Verdict's blockquote. The reference format integrates worst-case scenarios into the Verdict section; a standalone sub-section is a legacy layout.
  - `### Top Threats` / `### Top Critical Findings` / `### Critical Findings` → use `### Top Findings` table (F-NNN format, 7 columns).
  - `### Recommended Priority Actions` / `### Immediate Actions` → merged into `### Mitigations` (Prioritized Mitigations sub-table).
  - `### Follow-up Actions` (legacy name) → auto-rewrite to `### Mitigations` with two sub-tables.
  - `### Key Strengths` → auto-rewrite to `### Operational Strengths`.
  - `### Overall Security Rating` → the Verdict heading already carries the rating.
  - `#### Structural Defects` → merged into the Architecture Assessment table.
  - `### 1.1 Verdict` / `### 1.2 Top Findings` / any `### <digit>.<digit> <Name>` inside Management Summary → auto-strip the numeric prefix, keep the heading text.
- **No file paths or vscode:// links anywhere in the Management Summary.** F-NNN / M-NNN / T-NNN / TH-NN / C-NN links are allowed in the Verdict blockquote, Top Findings, Architecture Assessment (Key Findings / Enables column), and Mitigations. File references live in the Threat Register and Mitigation Register only.
- **No duplication — three roles, three places:** Management Summary = verdict-with-scenarios / top findings table / architecture defects table / mitigations / strengths. `## Critical Attack Chain` = attack-chain diagrams (visual). Threat Register = full per-finding detail (tabular).
