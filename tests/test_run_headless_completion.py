"""Drift guards for the headless-completion contract in run-headless.sh.

The deterministic compose logic (``_compose_if_ready`` via ``next``) is unit
tested in ``test_orchestration_controller.py``. These tests pin the *shell
wiring* that makes it fire on a bg-ceiling process-kill and that the artifact
gate is fail-closed on a missing ``threat-model.md`` — the 2026-07-03 gap where
a killed run left ``threat-model.yaml`` + fragments but no report and headless
reported ``✓ completed successfully`` (exit 0).
